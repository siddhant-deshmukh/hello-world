# hello-world
Just doing some timepass  
  
  Alright let's try something new . So i think we should begain with writing a simple HTML and CSS webpage or you can just create your react app here i mean you can try to deply it here . Actually this sounds good . Or you can create a form and try to store that information in Atlas . All this things may seems easy but they are not but still i think it's is worth of try . Or you can do combination of both like a calculator . Okay so let's begain !!
